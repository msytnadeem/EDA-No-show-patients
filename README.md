# EDA No-show Patients:

### Context
Over 110 thousand of medical appointments took place in Brazil, some patients did not show up for their appointments. the dataset contains 14 features including the present of the patient or not on his appointment date. The features can be classified into 4 groups, patient information (id, gender, age), appointment information (appointment id, appointment date, scheduled date, no show, sms received), health information (hypertension, diabetes, alcoholism, handicap) and social information (Neighborhood, Scholarship). by investigating the data set, I am trying to answer the following questions:

### Data:
* no_show_appointment.csv => contains data before cleaning up
* no_show_cleaned.csv => contains data after cleanup and wrangling.
